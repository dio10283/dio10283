assignment

My name is Dion, I am from the Philippines. I like to do very random stuff on my free time, but my most favorite thing to do is sleep. I've been playing games for my whole life now, and now I want to know how to make games. I personally think sandbox physic type games are the most fun for me. I think a VR game that is really realistic in physics would be really fun, like Blade and Sorcery. That is one of the projects I wish to explore more.
